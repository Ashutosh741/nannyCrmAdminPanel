9 PER MONTH PROFIT AND OVERALL PROFIT

  -->

<!-- --------SMALL Doubts ---------

aya assigned not cleared some point like

1.like agr aya assigned nhi hua hai to, aya ko assign kr do
ab jab nayi aaya ko assign krna hai tb, pooch lo, previous aaya ko rkhna hai ya nhi
agr rkhna hai to usi ke hisaab se ending date set kr do , us aaya ka
bas phir show kr do, ki kon kon se aaya aaigned hai kis kis customer ko
 
2 . ismein ek or case ban skta hai ki, agr koi aya aise nhi hai jo day night ke liye kaam kr rhi
to uske liye hmhe customer ko ek se adhik assign krna hoga 

 -->


<!-- BugsðŸ‘‡ ----

1 .create a check such that, when we generate bill, it should only be generated , when all the entries 
are filled.

2. entries are coming in reverse, correct it âœ…
 
3. when aya are deleting then it should not show assigned to anyone âœ…
